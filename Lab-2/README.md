## TITLE:
    Inheritance and Polymorphism in Java.

## OBJECTIVE:
    To gain practical experience in implementing inheritance and polymorphism concepts in Java programming.

## THEORY:
    Inheritance in Java allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The superclass provides the base structure, while the subclass extends it with additional features. Polymorphism refers to treating objects of different classes as objects of a common superclass. Method overriding is used to provide different implementations in subclasses.

## CONCLUSION:
    Inheritance and polymorphism are essential concepts in Java. Inheritance promotes code reusability, while polymorphism enhances flexibility. By utilizing these concepts, developers can create more efficient and modular code.
